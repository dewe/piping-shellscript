# Unix Philosophy Implementation Rules

## Core Principles
- **Do one thing well**: Single, focused transformation per script
- **Filter pattern**: Read from stdin, write to stdout
- **Line-by-line processing**: each line is processed individually
- **Composable**: Must work in pipelines with other tools
- **Silent on success**: Only output data, errors to stderr
- **Meaningful exit codes**: 0 for success, non-zero for errors

## Composability Requirements
- Must work with file input: `./script < input.txt`
- Must work in pipelines: `input | ./script | other_tool`
- Should handle empty input gracefully
- Should preserve line structure when processing multiple lines
